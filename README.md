## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/ai_jira
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database named `ai_jira`
   - Run the database migrations (you'll need to set up Drizzle migrations)

5. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üì± Usage

### Creating Your First Project
1. Go to the home page
2. Click "Create Project"
3. Enter project name and description
4. Click "Create Project"

### Managing Tickets
1. Navigate to your project
2. Switch between "Backlog" and "SCRUM Board" tabs
3. Create tickets with ADR structure (Context, Decision, Consequences)
4. Assign people to tickets
5. Move tickets through status columns

### Using AI Features
1. **Dependency Graph**: Click "See Dependencies" on any ticket to view the interactive graph
2. **AI Summarization**: Click "Summarize" to get AI-powered insights from dependent tickets
3. **People Management**: Add team members with usernames for @mention support

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Structure
Each ticket follows the ADR pattern:
- **Context**: What is the problem we're trying to solve?
- **Decision**: What is the decision we're making?
- **Consequences**: What are the consequences of this decision?
